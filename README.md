# the summery of project:
The objective of this project is to conduct market basket analysis to enhance customer satisfaction, improve product offerings, and improve sales and marketing strategies. We aim to answer questions such as which items are most commonly bought together, how frequently certain items are purchased together by customers, and whether certain items can be sold or cross-sold based on customers' buying patterns. We used the OSEMN framework for this project and analyzed transactional data from a Breadbasket in Edinburgh.

# We used the following tools in our project:
sql server 2019
Microsoft Excel
Python Programming language
Microsoft Power Bi
Microsoft PowerPoint

# data set:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains transactional data for the 'Breadbasket' in Edinburgh. It includes over 9,000 transactions and 20,507 entries with four columns - transaction number, items, date and time, and day part.

# Data cleaning and exploration:
We cleaned and explored the dataset using SQL Server. Cleanup steps included removing duplicates, handling missing values, converting data types, fixing inconsistent formatting, and removing irrelevant data. We then explored the data set by examining covariate distributions, testing covariate relationships, and performing statistical tests.

# Analysis and Modeling:
We conducted market basket analysis using association rule mining in Python. We analyzed the results to answer questions about which items are purchased most frequently together, how often customers buy certain items together, and whether we could upsell or cross-sell certain items based on customers' buying patterns.

# start:
We downloaded the dataset from Kaggle: Breadbasket
We setup SQL Server and import the dataset.
We cleaned and explored the data with SQL Server.
We installed Python and the libraries required for mining association rules, such as pandas, numpy, and mlxtend.
We ran the Python script to mine the association rules and analyze the results.

# Recommendations:
Based on the results of the market basket analysis, we recommend the following actions:

Promote the purchase of "coffee" and "bagel" together, as they are the most frequently purchased items and the most popular combination of the two.
Offer promotions or deals on frequently purchased items together, such as “coffee,” “cake,” “tea,” “cake,” “coffee,” and “pastries.”
Consider offering a variety of pastries to increase the popularity of the "coffee" and "pastry" combination.
Strategically place “coffee,” “bread,” and “tea” in high-traffic areas to increase visibility and encourage buying.
Encourage the purchase of "cake" and "coffee" together, as customers usually buy them together.
Sell or upsell items based on association rules generated by market basket analysis, such as promoting "hot chocolate" during the winter months.
By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders can improve sales and marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve product offerings.
